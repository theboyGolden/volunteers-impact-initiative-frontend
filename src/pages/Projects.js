              Volunteer Impact Initiative undertakes projects which focuses on plant (crop) and animal (poultry and rabbit) farming at the Mephibosheth Training Centre in the Central Region of Ghana.

              Located in Gomoa Ankamu, the Mephibosheth Training Centre is dedicated to offering education, care, and opportunities for growth to individuals with disabilities.
              Volunteers are encouraged to bring their knowledge, experience, and skills in farming to contribute to the success of the project. 
              Creativity and initiative are also valued as key components in driving positive outcomes.
